Core Infrastructure Requirements for ECS EC2 Launch Type
VPC

A custom VPC to isolate your ECS cluster network.

Enable DNS support and hostnames for service discovery.

Subnets

Multiple subnets across different Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.

Both public subnets (for NAT gateway, internet gateway) and private subnets (where ECS EC2 instances run).

ECS EC2 instances should be launched in private subnets to improve security.

Internet Gateway

Attach an Internet Gateway (IGW) to the VPC to enable internet access for public subnets.

Route Tables

Public route table that routes 0.0.0.0/0 traffic to the Internet Gateway.

Private route table(s) associated with private subnets.

Private route table must route outbound internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to a NAT Gateway (which resides in a public subnet) to allow ECS instances internet access for pulling images, updates, etc.

NAT Gateway (optional but recommended)

Allows ECS EC2 instances in private subnets to reach the internet securely.

Security Groups

Define security group(s) to control inbound/outbound traffic.

Open necessary ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 3000 for container app).

Egress open for outbound internet access.

IAM Role and Instance Profile

An IAM role with AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role policy attached.

IAM Instance Profile attached to EC2 instances, enabling ECS to manage containers securely.

ECS Cluster

An ECS cluster resource to logically group your EC2 container instances.

EC2 Instances (ECS Container Instances)

Launch EC2 instances inside private subnets.

Use ECS-optimized AMI.

Instance type as per your requirement (t3.medium in this case).

Pass user data to configure ECS agent to join the cluster.
